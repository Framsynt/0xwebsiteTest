# 0xVentures

This is the main project repository for 0xVentures - 0xVentures.org is the frontend for all web related projects born out of the greatest minds of LP University to be built with [React]( https://reactjs.org/), paired with a Mobile Application.

### Notes
Ideally, this repository will serve as a purpose for all Contributors/Developers to make adjustments along the way and to update this as we progress.

## Requirements overview
This will be a brief summary of intended features for both the Web Application and Mobile Web Application.

### Web Application:
* Admins should be able to whitelist User Crypto addresses
* User Login via Crypto address (proving you own the address, similar to snapshot.org etc) i.e Metamask
* A directory of our members
* Investments
* Application for group inclusion?
* Contact form(s)/link(s)
* Treasury Wallet
* A landing page that shows our roadmap
* Projects
* Project status (Open, Closed, Ready for Funds, etc)
* Pitch deck links, Twitter/Discord links, etc. Basically a repository of data for that project (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1j5wjkgyeAMHueir17vfAKIBZED4nDUVS?usp=sharing)
* Form for filling out participating in projects, although tbh it’s probably still easier to do via Google Forms for the time being
* Proposals
* Create/edit a proposal
* Comments
* Voting (can be implemented as anon voting)



### Mobile Web Application:
* User Account Creation
* User login




## Roadmap
* Smart contracts for DAO handling
* Arb bots
* 0xResearch
  - Could be hosted on our website, but deeper research articles on new projects, existing projects, articles on valuation or simply things like which projects are most out-of-alignment in valuation/market cap with other similar projects

* Security Audits
  - One thing that’s hot as a pancake griddle right now is smart contract security auditing. Wouldn’t hurt to perhaps sponsor a dev to learn the ins-and-outs of     that as a revenue generation tool. Could contract with projects to offer security audits for a percentage of tokens or cash.
  - Website

* Our Vision as a DAO
  - We add value to every project we touch.  We believe in a decentralized world that offers equal opportunity for all.  We are more than just capital           investment, we are an organization full of life, eager to innovate, inspire, & contribute to every project we engage with.
  - The way we add value is to first understand the needs of a project & then contribute via:
  - Capital
  - Relationships
  - Advisement
  - Tool Building
