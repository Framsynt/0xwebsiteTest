          <p>
            Not your regular VCs, we are a community of blockchain users who
            have deep experience in blockchain and crypto communities.
          </p>
          <p>
            0xVentures' skilled team actively participates with projects we are
            invested in. Our partner investments are chosen not just by consumer
            use case, but also a deeply personal view. Our first principle of
            working with communities brings value through understanding of users
            and broad network information sharing, which leads to organic
            project expansion.

          <h2>Our mission</h2>

          <p>
            0xVentures is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that
            functions as a treasury with the sole purpose of investing in
            sector-disrupting projects. These projects are researched in both an
            external macro setting and micro discourse with the teams. Our
            recognition both as a brand and individuals, provides us a unique
            opportunity to drive engagement across many blockchain communities.

          <h2>Our value</h2>

          <p>
            We pride ourselves in being value-add investors. With diverse
            backgrounds and expertise, we provide a unique perspective to the
            projects in terms of marketing, UI/UX design, financing and
            programming. This also opens up our investment strategy to multiple
            sectors, including blockchain specific protocols, gaming, NFTs,
            decentralised exchanges and many more.

          <h2>Why DAO?</h2>

          <p>
            We are an internet-native organisation which is collectively owned
            and managed by our members. We have no central leadership, anyone
            can introduce a change or proposal, it is then discussed and voted
            on as a community. 0xVentures believes that the DAO format is the
            ideal organizational path to foster community, creativity and more
            informed decision making.

          <p>
            Each member is critically chosen. This is done to foster an
            environment where we work together as one unit that shares, evolves
            and brings ideas into fruition.
