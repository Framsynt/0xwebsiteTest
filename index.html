          We are a decentralized autonomous organization that functions as a

          Collectively owned and managed by our members, our activity is written
          directly into blockchain. We have no central leadership, anyone can
          introduce a change or proposal. This is then discussed by our
          community until consensus is reached. We believe this is the ideal
          organizational path to foster community, creativity, and the highest
          caliber decisions.

          first principle of working with communities brings value through
          understanding your users and broadband sharing, which leads to organic
          project expansion.
